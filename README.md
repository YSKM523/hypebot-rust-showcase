# hypebot-rust-showcase | Rust Hyperliquid Trading Bot

A public-facing showcase for a private Rust-based Hyperliquid trading bot built with production-grade architecture: typed market data pipelines, per-symbol runners, serialized order execution, persistent state, dry-run support, and long-running websocket resilience.

## Snapshot

- Language: Rust
- Async runtime: Tokio
- Exchange target: Hyperliquid
- Visibility model: private source, public showcase
- Core pitch: reliability-first trading infrastructure rather than a toy bot script

> The implementation repository is private. This showcase exists to share what is being built, the engineering direction, and progress — without exposing the full source.

## Why This Exists

Most trading bot repos show signal logic first and treat everything else as an afterthought — brittle runtimes, weak execution discipline, poor recoverability. `hypebot-rs` is built from the opposite direction: **reliability first, then strategy.**

The focus is on the parts that separate a toy bot from a serious one:

- **Websocket resilience** — lifecycle management that survives disconnects, stale feeds, and reconnect storms
- **Serialized execution** — single-path order flow to eliminate exchange-side race conditions and nonce collisions
- **Per-symbol isolation** — independent task groups so one market never contaminates another
- **Persistent state** — local bot state restored across restarts so strategy context isn't lost
- **Safe iteration** — dry-run mode and Discord notifications for runtime observability

## Why It Feels Like Rust

This project is not just "a bot that happens to be written in Rust." The system shape itself is Rust-native:

- async task orchestration built around `Tokio`
- typed event boundaries instead of loose dict passing
- explicit `Result`-style error handling and recoverability
- isolated runners and channels that map cleanly to long-running services
- strategy and execution boundaries that benefit from stronger types and ownership discipline

## Why Rust Is A Strength Here

Rust is not just a branding choice for this project. It improves the fit between the codebase and the problem:

- **Safer long-running runtime behavior**: fewer hidden runtime surprises for a process that is expected to stay alive across reconnects, stale feeds, and order events
- **Stronger concurrency model**: async tasks, channels, and isolated runners map naturally onto market data, strategy, and execution pipelines
- **Type-driven system design**: typed events and commands make it easier to reason about what can move through the system
- **Better execution discipline**: clearer ownership and explicit state transitions help keep order flow and recovery logic coherent
- **More credible systems engineering**: for visitors, Rust signals that this is being built as infrastructure, not just as a disposable script

Public illustrative Rust example:

- [Cargo.toml](./Cargo.toml)
- [src/lib.rs](./src/lib.rs)

```rust
use tokio::sync::mpsc;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum MarketEvent {
    CandleClosed { symbol: String, close: f64 },
}

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum OrderCommand {
    EnterLong { symbol: String, price: f64 },
}

pub struct SymbolRunner {
    symbol: String,
}

impl SymbolRunner {
    pub async fn run(self, mut market_rx: mpsc::Receiver<MarketEvent>, order_tx: mpsc::Sender<OrderCommand>) {
        while let Some(event) = market_rx.recv().await {
            match event {
                MarketEvent::CandleClosed { close, .. } if close > 0.0 => {
                    let _ = order_tx
                        .send(OrderCommand::EnterLong {
                            symbol: self.symbol.clone(),
                            price: close,
                        })
                        .await;
                }
                _ => {}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The private implementation is more complete than this snippet, but the architecture style is the same: typed flows, async runners, and explicit execution boundaries.

## Architecture

![hypebot-rs architecture overview](assets/architecture.png)

The system is split into four distinct layers:

| Layer | Components | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Transport** | `HlWsClient`, `HlRestClient` | Websocket subscriptions, heartbeat, reconnect flow, HTTP order interface |
| **Processing** | `MarketFeed`, `SymbolRunner`, `Strategy` | Typed event pipeline, per-symbol lifecycle, signal generation |
| **Execution** | `OrderExecutor`, `PositionTracker` | Serialized exchange calls, order state tracking |
| **Infrastructure** | `State`, `Watchdog`, `DiscordNotifier` | Persistent context, runtime health monitoring, Discord alerts + dry-run |

## Strategy

Current strategy centers on a **breakout-retest approach** with layered filters:

1. Structure break detection
2. Retest confirmation windows
3. ADX trend strength gating
4. ATR-based buffers and stop logic
5. Bollinger Band width filtering
6. Volume ratio checks
7. Time filters and cooldown handling

Not "buy when X crosses Y" — this encodes market structure, volatility context, and execution discipline into the strategy layer.

## Roadmap

**Runtime** — improve connection health visibility, startup/recovery reporting, edge-case handling around disconnects and state restoration

**Strategy** — refine breakout-retest across volatility regimes, add additional strategy modules, improve parameter documentation

**Execution** — deepen reporting around order states (resting, filled, canceled, failed), improve stop placement and recovery after abnormal responses
